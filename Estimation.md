Estimation Best practices

* Have good Domain knowledge
* Understand scope of the problem
* Build a mental model of the solution(high level), will help in estimating.
* Brea the model into components.
* Remember, you cannot give an estimation at the start of the project, it would be a guess. Correct Estimation is an incremental approach it needs experience with the project (domain, code etc.) `Eat an elephant, one bite at a time`
* If not clear, ask
* Tell not the exact number always, give a range as it depends on team, productivity, environment etc.
* If estimation goes wrong, learn and correct.
* Say, I will get back to you with the points.
