#### I am in charge
Martin Fowler says, “you can change your organization or change your organization.”

#### Take Responsibility
- Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don’t blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

#### Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses
If something I broke or late or can't be done, have some optimal/non-optimal solution in mind before communicating. Take help of colleauges, internet or book, if something is unknown.

#### Don’t Live with Broken Windows
Bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code unrepaired. sooner I fix, easier it is. Ideally as a part of implementing a new functionality.

#### Be a catalyst for change.
- Ex. People in the team/company will be relunctant to initial change, will make excuses may be a budget or something else. 
Give them something which works like a prototype and tell them, if you add your resources, this will be even better and so on.
 
- Keep an eye on the big picture. Constantly review what’s happening around you, not just what you personally are doing.

#### Make Quality a Requirements Issue.
- Do not ignore the quality and if you estimate for it, it won't be ignored, even though there is a deadline.
- Involve users from the begining to have the feedback and to know that whether I am going in right direction.
- Know when to stop, Don’t spoil a perfectly good program by overembellishment and overrefinement. Move on, and let your code stand in its own right for a while. It may not be perfect. Don’t worry: it could never be perfect.

#### My Knowledge Portfolio

Implement below for knowledge as assets - 

- Serious investors invest regularly—as a habit.
  > Read and practive regulary, make it a habit. Learn a new language every year.
- Diversification is the key to long-term success.
  > Read not only technolgy books, but soft skills books also (Don’t forget the human side of the equation, as that requires an entirely different skill set).
- Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high-reward investments.
  > Spend my time in learning new tech which is high in demand, and lesser time in 
- Investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return.
  > Learning an emerging technology before it becomes popular can be just as hard as finding an undervalued stock, but the payoff can be just as rewarding for ex. early adopters of Golang.
- Portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically.
  > What you have learned, practice it, else I will forget it.
- Participate in local user groups and meetups: 
    Isolation can be deadly to your career; find out what people are working on outside of your company. Don’t just go and listen: actively participate. 
- Stay current: 
    Read news and posts online on technology different from that of your current project. It’s a great way to find out what experiences other people are having with it, the particular jargon they use, and so on. 
- Once I feel comfortable with some new language or bit of technology, move on. Learn another one. Whether I use it in a project, but it will give me a different paradigm to use.
for. ex. how can I apply functional programming paradigm in OO paradigm. so continue learning.

#### Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear

- Ask the “Five Whys”
- Who does this benefit?
- What’s the context?
  > What are the prerequisites, what are the consequences, short and long term? 
- When or Where would this work?
- Why is this a problem?

#### Communication

- Know What You Want to Say.
  > jot down the major points I want to communicate and plan the whole thing before going to meeting or even when writing a documentation/RFC etc.
- Make documentation and integral part of daily coding. It should be close to code. Make public function have the comments. try not to have comments for non-API
changes, if at all do, write "why" this is done not "how" as the code itself saying it.
