- Don't Panic
- The key to solving puzzles is both to recognize the constraints placed on you and to recognize the degrees of freedom you do have
- We want to identify the most restrictive constraints first, and fit the remaining constraints within them while solving problem.
- It’s not whether you think inside the box or outside the box. The problem lies in finding the box—identifying the real constraints.
- People who were distracted did better on a complex problem-solving task than people who put in conscious effort.
Sometime when you are stuck, you can take a walk, [distract yourself](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-work/201209/stop-trying-solve-problems) or reiterate the same problem to your friend (or a rubber duck).

#### When it comes to observation, fortune favors the prepared mind.
That is true for problem solving, too. In order to have those eureka! moments, your nonconscious brain needs to have plenty of raw material; prior experiences that can contribute to an answer.
A great way to feed your brain is to give it feedback on what works and what doesn’t work as you do your daily job and best tool is to use Engineering Daybook (simply a notebook, where you can jot down ideas)
