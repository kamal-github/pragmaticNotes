### Beware
- Don't program by concidence,
- If it is running, know **why** it is running at the first plcae, to identify why it is not running this time.
- Don’t assume it, prove it.
- Have a proper code review of self & others. Look for unncessary pieces that is eventually making the code to run.
- Don't just find the pattern from small input whether its the data.
- Coincidences can mislead at all levels—from generating requirements through to testing. Testing is particularly fraught with false causalities and coincidental outcomes. 
- Assumptions that aren’t based on well-established facts are the bane of all projects.


### DO This
- Document your assumptions and Assert them in tests also.
- Try using whiteboard, talk to more Jr dev, if I can bit explain, perhaps I am relying on coincidences.
- If you’re not sure why it works, you won’t know why it fails.
- Always be aware of what you are doing.
- Refactor the existing code, if historical code I see seems to be poorly designed/not correct. **DO NOT continu doing the same**.
