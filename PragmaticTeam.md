- Maintain Small, Stable Teams, ideal team should be not more than 8-10 and cross functional.
- Quality is a team issue, not only of individual.
- Encourage everyone to actively monitor the environment for changes. Stay awake and aware for increased scope, decreased time scales, additional features, new environments—anything that wasn’t in the original understanding. 
Keep metrics on new requirements. The team needn’t reject changes out of hand—you simply need to be aware that they’re happening.
- Schedule It to Make It Happen
If you think, when I get free time, I will attempt it, it is never gonna happen.
e.g. Learning a new skill.
- New tech experiments
- Protype it and check if it works for your team and projects. Don't use it if otheres are using or in fashion.
- Don’t Repeat Yourselves by effective, smooth and frictionless communication (here I mean, it should not take a week for communication to take place.)
