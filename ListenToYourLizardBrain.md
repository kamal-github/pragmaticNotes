- While reading someone else's code, **jot down** if something new or strange seen, may be there is a pattern that I can learn or improve.
- While starting a new project/architecture/or any thing from blank screen page or whenever have a feeling of fear of error. Just think that **I am prototyping**
and I am anyways gonna throw this will help me atleast start and once the protype ready throw it and start afresh.
- Take a walk, move away from the keyboard when I am stuck, let the brain settle down.
