#### Requirements Documents Are for Planning, and they are for developers to ask questions, get feedback and implement it.

#### Requirements Documents Are not for Client, they will never read it.

#### Requirement vs Policy

Implement the general case, with the policy information as an example of the type of thing the system needs to support. Policy is just a metadata or a special case.

#### General guidelines 

- Use sticky note/index card for requirement, which is small and does not contain a lot of information and that's the whole points, this opens up the possibilty to ask questions by devs and feedback.

- Feedback from client/user is most essential during the whole software development process.
